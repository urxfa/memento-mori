## How much time do you have left?

Memento Mori is a Latin phrase that translates to "Remember that you will die."

Rooted in ancient Roman traditions, this concept serves as a powerful reminder of life's impermanence and the inevitability of death.

Far from being a morbid reflection, Memento Mori encourages mindfulness, prompting individuals to focus on what truly matters. It inspires people to live with intention, make meaningful choices, and embrace their mortality with humility.

The idea has been embraced across many cultures and philosophies, particularly in Stoicism and Christian art, as a way to lead a more purposeful and grounded life.
